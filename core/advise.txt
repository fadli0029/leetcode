In general, for any class, you'll ALWAYS need the following:

1. Constructor
2. Copy constructor, deep copy
3. Copy constructor, transfer resource (does not perform deep copy)

4. Destructor

5. Assignment operator, deep copy
6. Assignment operator, transfer resource (does not perform deep copy)

For data structures, you ALWAYS need member functions from each of these categories:

1. Capacity:
   - empty()
   - size()

2. Element access:
   - front()
   - back()
   note: some may use different implementations like operator[] to access elements, at() method, etc.

3. Modifiers:
   - insert()
   - erase()

And for each of those categories, each data structure may have extra member functions that other data structures do not have.
